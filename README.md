This repo accompanies the blog post [Estimating Body Mass Index from Face Images Using Keras and Transfer Learning](https://medium.com/@leosimmons/making-a-bmi-classifier-with-keras-and-transfer-learning-de25e1bc0212).

<b>Instructions for running the demo</b>

1. Clone this repo
2. Make sure requirements in `requirements.txt` are installed
3. Download [the trained model weights](https://medium.com/@leosimmons/estimating-body-mass-index-from-face-images-using-keras-and-transfer-learning-de25e1bc0212) and put file in the repo directory
4. `python demo.py`

If you have more than one face in the frame of your video camera, run the script with the `--multiple` flag, or else the results will be off.
